# DEXON: Real-Time Safety for Every Child

DEXON is an innovative platform designed to ensure real-time safety and emotional well-being for needer's through AI-powered monitoring and instant parental engagement.

## 🌟 Overview

Verbal abuse affects 36% of children globally, often going unnoticed even in developed countries. DEXON addresses this silent epidemic by bridging the communication gap between needer's and guardian while offering emotional support and safety tools.

## 🚨 The Problem

- **Prevalence of Verbal Abuse**: 76.5% of verbal abuse cases come from parents—those meant to protect.
- **Mental Health Crisis**: Leads to depression, anxiety, self-harm, and long-term brain damage. Costs exceed $300 billion annually.
- **Communication Barriers**: Children rarely voice their distress; parents remain unaware.
- **Emotional Disconnection**: Teens often feel misunderstood and isolated.
